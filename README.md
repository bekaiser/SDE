# stochastic_RK4_integration
The scripts in this repository stochastically integrate the Frankignoul &amp; Hasselmann (1976) stochastic forcing model of ocean-atmosphere heat flux interaction. The forcing is Gaussian white noise and the integration scheme is an adaptation of 4th-order Runge Kutta integration.
